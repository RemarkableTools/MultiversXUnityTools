# MultiversX Unity Tools

### Overview
A work-in-progress set of tools to interact with MultiversX Blockchain directly from a Unity app.  
We intend to keep our APIs as simple as possible and every action to be done with just a single line of code. 

### Package
Download and import the Unity package from [Releases tab](https://github.com/chainofindustry/ElrondUnityDevelopmentTools/releases/) to use the plugin in your project.

### Demo
PC demo app is available on the [Releases tab](https://github.com/chainofindustry/ElrondUnityDevelopmentTools/releases/).  

### Video Tutorial
Soon

### External Dependencies
We did not developed these tools but adapt them to work with our integration.
